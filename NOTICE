This project contains a number of changes and difference in functionality with
regards to the original project, including:
* The ability to mark methods with attributes so that only the marked methods
  are analyzed for allocations ("hot path analysis").
* Settings to control file patterns and attributes for analysis exclusion
* The ability to change the severities of the different rules
* Removal of the HeapAllocationAnalyzerEventSource
